# Assembly wrapper for CCall on an object-capability.  Its function is to save
# and restore any general-purpose and capability registers needed on either
# side of CCall, but not handled by the compiler.  This is done by creating an
# on-stack frame which will be pointed to by $idc before CCall, and then
# unwrapping it again.  We rely on the compiler and CCall to sort out clearing
# of registers that require it, since they have the information to do so.
#
# Calling conventions into cheri_invoke:
#
# Registers	Description
# $c0		MIPS address space
# $c1, $c2	Invoked capabilities
# $c3..$c10	Argument capabilities
# $c11..$c16	Caller-save capabilities
# $c17..$c24	Callee-save capabilities
# $c26		IDC
#
# Calling conventions implemented around CCall:
#
# $c1		Invoked code capability
# $c2		Invoked data capability
# $c3..$c10	Argument capabilities; $c3 as return capability
# $c11..$c16	n/a
# $c17..$c24	n/a
# $c26		IDC
#
# XXXRW: Worries/TODO:
#
# - Floating-point registers.
# - The compiler needs to handle unused argument/return registers.

	#
	# Wrap up all caller-save state suitable to be preseved by CCall and
	# restored by CReturn.  This happens in two phases:
	#
	# 1. First, use the conventional stack to save as many caller-save
	# general-purpose and capability registers as possible.
	#
	# 2. Produce a value for $idc that bundles these up suitable to
	# bootstrap trestoration.  This will save the original $idc, $csp,
	# $sp, and $c0.
	#
	# Then after CReturn, reverse these steps by first unwrapping $idc,
	# and then performing a more normal function return.
	#
	# The caller $idc will describe a stack fragment, which gives us a bit
	# of space to store useful things, such as $sp, that are otherwise
	# quite hard to restore (for obvious reasons).
	#
	# Save callee-save general-purpose registers.
	#
	# Caller-save registers are: $s0..$s7, $gp, $sp, $s8 ($fp).
	#
	# Do also save $ra so that we can return properly.
	#
	# Don't save $sp as CCall will do that for us.
	#
	# NB: Use 96 rather than 88 for the stack to ensure 32-byte alignment
	# for capabilities stored and loaded from it later.
	#
	# XXXRW: Possibly with the __ccall calling convention, the compiler
	# should be doing this?
