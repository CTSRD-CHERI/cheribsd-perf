#
# Assembly wrapper for CCall on an object-capability.  Its function is to
# save, clear, and restore general-purpose and capability registers as needed
# on either side of CCall.  $c0/$sp assumed to provide a valid stack, and the
# caller must have set up $c1, $c2, and general-purpose/capability argument
# registers before calling this function.
#
# Calling conventions into cheri_invoke:
#
# Registers	Description			Before, After
# $c0		MIPS address space		Save/Clear, Restore
# $c1, $c2	Invoked capabilities		Pass through, Clear
# $c3..$c10	Argument capabilities		Pass through, Clear
# $c11..$c16	Caller-save capabilities	Clear, Clear
# $c17..$c24	Callee-save capabilities	Save/Clear, Restore
# $c26		IDC				Handled by CCall
#
# Calling conventions implemented around CCall:
#
# $c1		Invoked code capability
# $c2		Invoked data capability
# $c3..$c10	Argument capabilities
# $c11..$c16	n/a
# $c17..$c24	n/a
# $c26		IDC
#
# XXXRW: Worries/TODO:
#
# - Floating-point registers.
# - Unused argument registers (capability and general-purpose) -- only the
#   caller knows which are used, and hence which need to be scrubbed.
# - Check that CCall scrubs $sp in callee.
# - What about $c25?  Should we swap $c25 and $c26 in the ISA definition?
# - Easy to imagine a #ifdef FAST_BUT_LOOSE that does less clearing but trusts
#   the compiler more.  Would also be nice to have a CClearMask that took a
#   bitmask of capability registers to flush -- and likeways ClearMask for
#   MIPS registers.
# - Not yet using $c11 for stack access, so we depend on $c0 and $c11 being
#   the same.  At least we save/restore $c11?

	#
	# Wrap up all caller-save state suitable to be preseved by CCall and
	# restored by CReturn.  This happens in two phases:
	#
	# 1. First, use the conventional stack to save as many caller-save
	# general-purpose and capability registers as possible.
	#
	# 2. Produce a value for $idc that bundles these up suitable to
	# bootstrap trestoration.  This will save the original $idc, $csp,
	# $sp, and $c0.
	#
	# Then after CReturn, reverse these steps by first unwrapping $idc,
	# and then performing a more normal function return.
	#
	# The caller $idc will describe a stack fragment, which gives us a bit
	# of space to store useful things, such as $sp, that are otherwise
	# quite hard to restore (for obvious reasons).
	#
	# Save callee-save general-purpose registers.
	#
	# Caller-save registers are: $s0..$s7, $gp, $sp, $s8 ($fp).
	#
	# Do also save $ra so that we can return properly.
	#
	# Don't save $sp as CCall will do that for us.
	#
	# NB: Use 96 rather than 88 for the stack to ensure 32-byte alignment
	# for capabilities stored and loaded from it later.
